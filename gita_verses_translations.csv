"Dhṛtarāṣṭra said: O Sanjaya, what did my sons and the sons of Pandu do when they assembled on the sacred field of Kurukshetra, eager for battle?","धृतराष्ट्र उवाच

"O teacher, behold this vast army of the sons of Pandu, arrayed for battle by the intelligent disciple of Drupada.","पश्यैतां पाण्डुपुत्राणामाचार्य महतीं चमूम्।

व्यूढां द्रुपदपुत्रेण तव शिष्येण धीमता।।1.3।।

"Here are the heroes wielding great bows, who in battle are peers of Bhima and Arjuna: Yuyudhana (Satyaki) and Virata, and the maharatha (great chariot-rider) Drupada;","अत्र शूरा महेष्वासा भीमार्जुनसमा युधि।

युयुधानो विराटश्च द्रुपदश्च महारथः।।1.4।।

"Dhrstaketu, Cekitana, and the valiant king of Kasi (Varanasi); Purujit, Kuntibhoja, and Saibya, the choicest of men;","धृष्टकेतुश्चेकितानः काशिराजश्च वीर्यवान्।

पुरुजित्कुन्तिभोजश्च शैब्यश्च नरपुङ्गवः।।1.5।।

"And the valiant Yudhamanyu, and the chivalrous Uttamaujas; the son of Subhadra (Abhimanyu) and the sons of Draupadi—all of them are, indeed, maharathas.","युधामन्युश्च विक्रान्त उत्तमौजाश्च वीर्यवान्।

सौभद्रो द्रौपदेयाश्च सर्व एव महारथाः।।1.6।।

"But, O best among the Brahmanas, please be appraised of those who are foremost among us, the founders of my army. I speak of them to you by way of illustration.","अस्माकं तु विशिष्टा ये तान्निबोध द्विजोत्तम।

"(They are): Your venerable self, Bhisma, Karna, and Krpa, who is ever victorious in battle; Asvatthama, Vikarna, Saumadatti, and Jayadratha.","भवान्भीष्मश्च कर्णश्च कृपश्च समितिञ्जयः।

"There are many heroes who have dedicated their lives to me, possessing various kinds of weapons and missiles, all of whom are skilled in battle.","अन्ये च बहवः शूरा मदर्थे त्यक्तजीविताः।

नानाशस्त्रप्रहरणाः सर्वे युद्धविशारदाः।।1.9।।
 ",9
"Therefore, our army, under the complete protection of Bhisma and others, is limitless. But this army of the enemies, under the protection of Bhima and others, is limited.","अपर्याप्तं तदस्माकं बलं भीष्माभिरक्षितम्।

पर्याप्तं त्विदमेतेषां बलं भीमाभिरक्षितम्।।1.10।।

"However, venerable sirs, all of you without exception, while occupying all the positions in the different directions as allotted to you respectively, please protect Bhisma in particular.","अयनेषु च सर्वेषु यथाभागमवस्थिताः।

भीष्ममेवाभिरक्षन्तु भवन्तः सर्व एव हि।।1.11।।
 ",11
"The valiant grandfather, the eldest of the Kurus, loudly sounding a lion's roar, blew the conch to raise his (Duryodhana's) spirits.","तस्य संजनयन्हर्षं कुरुवृद्धः पितामहः।

सिंहनादं विनद्योच्चैः शङ्खं दध्मौ प्रतापवान्।।1.12।।
 ",12
"Just immediately afterward, conch shells, kettledrums, tabors, trumpets, and cow-horns blared forth, creating a tumultuous sound.","ततः शङ्खाश्च भेर्यश्च पणवानकगोमुखाः।

सहसैवाभ्यहन्यन्त स शब्दस्तुमुलोऽभवत्।।1.13।।
 ",13
"Then Madhava (Krishna) and the son of Pandu (Arjuna), stationed in their magnificent chariot with white horses yoked to it, blew their divine conchs loudly.","ततः श्वेतैर्हयैर्युक्ते महति स्यन्दने स्थितौ।

माधवः पाण्डवश्चैव दिव्यौ शङ्खौ प्रदध्मतुः।।1.14।।
 ",14
Hrsikesa (Krsna) blew the conch Pancajanya; Dhananjaya (Arjuna) blew the conch Devadatta; and Vrkodara (Bhima) of terrible deeds blew the great conch Paundra.,"पाञ्चजन्यं हृषीकेशो देवदत्तं धनंजयः।

पौण्ड्रं दध्मौ महाशङ्खं भीमकर्मा वृकोदरः।।1.15।।

"And the King of Kashi, wielding a great bow, and the great chariot-rider Sikhandin, Dhrstadyumna, Virata, and Satyaki the unconquered;","काश्यश्च परमेष्वासः शिखण्डी च महारथः।

"Drupada and the sons of Draupadi, as well as the mighty-armed son of Subhadra, all of them together, O king, blew their respective conchs.","द्रुपदो द्रौपदेयाश्च सर्वशः पृथिवीपते।

सौभद्रश्च महाबाहुः शङ्खान्दध्मुः पृथक्पृथक्।।1.18।।
 ",18
That tremendous sound pierced the hearts of the sons of Dhrtarastra as it reverberated through the sky and the earth.,"स घोषो धार्तराष्ट्राणां हृदयानि व्यदारयत्।

नभश्च पृथिवीं चैव तुमुलो व्यनुनादयन्।।1.19।।
 ",19
"O King, thereafter, seeing Dhrtarastra's men standing in their positions, with all the weapons ready for action, the son of Pandu, Arjuna, who had the insignia of Hanuman on his chariot-flag, raised his bow and said the following to Hrsikesa.","अथ व्यवस्थितान् दृष्ट्वा धार्तराष्ट्रान्कपिध्वजः।

प्रवृत्ते शस्त्रसंपाते धनुरुद्यम्य पाण्डवः।।1.20।।

Until I survey those who stand intent on fighting and those who are about to engage in battle with me in this impending war.,"यावदेतान्निरीक्षेऽहं योद्धुकामानवस्थितान्।

कैर्मया सह योद्धव्यमस्मिन्रणसमुद्यमे।।1.22।।

"These who have assembled here and want to accomplish in the war what is dear to the perverted son of Dhrtarastra, I find them to be intent on fighting.","योत्स्यमानानवेक्षेऽहं य एतेऽत्र समागताः।

धार्तराष्ट्रस्य दुर्बुद्धेर्युद्धे प्रियचिकीर्षवः।।1.23।।
 ",23
"Sanjaya said, ""O scion of the line of Bharata, Hrishikesa, being told so by Gudakesa (Arjuna), placed the excellent chariot between the two armies, in front of Bhishma and Drona as well as all the rulers of the earth, and said, 'O Partha, behold these assembled Kurus!'""","संजय उवाच

"Sanjaya said, ""O scion of the line of Bharata (Dhrtarashtra), Hrsikesa, being told so by Gudakesa (Arjuna), placed the excellent chariot between the two armies, in front of Bhisma and Drona as well as all the rulers of the earth, and said, 'O Partha (Arjuna), behold these assembled people of the Kuru dynasty.'""","भीष्मद्रोणप्रमुखतः सर्वेषां च महीक्षिताम्।

"The son of Kunti, Arjuna, seeing all those relatives arrayed there, became overwhelmed by supreme compassion and sorrowfully said this:","श्वशुरान्सुहृदश्चैव सेनयोरुभयोरपि।

तान्समीक्ष्य स कौन्तेयः सर्वान्बन्धूनवस्थितान्।।1.27।।

"And there is trembling in my body, and my hair stands on end; the Gandiva (bow) slips from my hand and my skin burns intensely.","सीदन्ति मम गात्राणि मुखं च परिशुष्यति।

वेपथुश्च शरीरे मे रोमहर्षश्च जायते।।1.29।।
 ",29
"Moreover, O Kesava (Krishna), I am not able to stand firmly, and my mind seems to be whirling. And I observe the omens to be adverse.","गाण्डीवं स्रंसते हस्तात्त्वक्चैव परिदह्यते।

न च शक्नोम्यवस्थातुं भ्रमतीव च मे मनः।।1.30।।
 ",30
"Besides, I do not see any good to be derived from killing my own people in battle. O Krsna, I do not hanker after victory, nor even a kingdom, nor pleasures.","निमित्तानि च पश्यामि विपरीतानि केशव।

न च श्रेयोऽनुपश्यामि हत्वा स्वजनमाहवे।।1.31।।
 ",31
"O Govinda! What need do we have of a kingdom, or what need of enjoyments and livelihood? Those for whom kingdom, enjoyments, and pleasures are desired by us—such as teachers, uncles, fathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law, as well as relatives—those very ones stand arrayed for battle, risking their lives and wealth.","न काङ्क्षे विजयं कृष्ण न च राज्यं सुखानि च।

"- O Govinda! What need do we have of a kingdom, or what need of enjoyments and livelihood?

"- O Govinda! What need do we have of a kingdom, or what need of enjoyments and livelihood? Those for whom kingdom, enjoyments, and pleasures are desired by us—such as teachers, uncles, fathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law, as well as relatives—those very ones stand arrayed for battle, risking their lives and wealth.","आचार्याः पितरः पुत्रास्तथैव च पितामहाः।

"O Madhusudana, even if I am killed, I do not want to kill these even for the sake of a kingdom extending across the three worlds; let alone doing so for the earth!","एतान्न हन्तुमिच्छामि घ्नतोऽपि मधुसूदन।

अपि त्रैलोक्यराज्यस्य हेतोः किं नु महीकृते।।1.35।।
 ",35
"O Janardana, what happiness will we gain by killing the sons of Dhrtarastra? We will only incur sin by killing these wrongdoers.","निहत्य धार्तराष्ट्रान्नः का प्रीतिः स्याज्जनार्दन।

पापमेवाश्रयेदस्मान्हत्वैतानाततायिनः।।1.36।।
 ",36
"Therefore, it is not proper for us to kill the sons of Dhrtarastra, who are our own relatives. For, O Madhava, how can we be happy by killing our kinsmen?","तस्मान्नार्हा वयं हन्तुं धार्तराष्ट्रान्स्वबान्धवान्।

स्वजनं हि कथं हत्वा सुखिनः स्याम माधव।।1.37।।
 ",37
"- O Janardana, although these people, whose hearts have become perverted by greed, do not see the evil arising from destroying the family and sinning in hostility towards friends, yet how can we, who clearly see the evil arising from destroying the family, remain unaware of the need to abstain from this sin?","यद्यप्येते न पश्यन्ति लोभोपहतचेतसः।

 ",38
"- O Janardana, although these people, whose hearts have become perverted by greed, do not see the evil arising from destroying the family and sinning in hostility towards friends, yet how can we, who clearly see the evil arising from destroying the family, remain unaware of the need to abstain from this sin?","कथं न ज्ञेयमस्माभिः पापादस्मान्निवर्तितुम्।

कुलक्षयकृतं दोषं प्रपश्यद्भिर्जनार्दन।।1.39।।
 ",39
"From the ruin of the family, the traditional rites and duties are totally destroyed. When rites and duties are destroyed, vice overwhelms the entire family.","कुलक्षये प्रणश्यन्ति कुलधर्माः सनातनाः।

धर्मे नष्टे कुलं कृत्स्नमधर्मोऽभिभवत्युत।।1.40।।
 ",40
"O Krishna, when vice predominates, the women of the family become corrupt. O descendant of the Vrsnis, when women become corrupted, it results in the intermingling of castes.","अधर्माभिभवात्कृष्ण प्रदुष्यन्ति कुलस्त्रियः।

स्त्रीषु दुष्टासु वार्ष्णेय जायते वर्णसङ्करः।।1.41।।
 ",41
And the intermingling in the family leads the ruiners of the family verily into hell. The forefathers of these fall down (into hell) due to being deprived of the offerings of rice-balls and water.,"सङ्करो नरकायैव कुलघ्नानां कुलस्य च।

पतन्ति पितरो ह्येषां लुप्तपिण्डोदकक्रियाः।।1.42।।
 ",42
"Due to the misdeeds of the ruiners of the family, which cause intermingling of castes, the traditional rites and duties of the castes and families are destroyed.","दोषैरेतैः कुलघ्नानां वर्णसङ्करकारकैः।

उत्साद्यन्ते जातिधर्माः कुलधर्माश्च शाश्वताः।।1.43।।
 ",43
"O Janardana, we have heard that living in hell is inevitable for those whose family duties are destroyed.","उत्सन्नकुलधर्माणां मनुष्याणां जनार्दन।

नरकेऽनियतं वासो भवतीत्यनुशुश्रुम।।1.44।।
 ",44
"What a pity that we have resolved to commit a great sin, eager to kill our own kith and kin out of greed for the pleasures of a kingdom!","अहो बत महत्पापं कर्तुं व्यवसिता वयम्।

यद्राज्यसुखलोभेन हन्तुं स्वजनमुद्यताः।।1.45।।
 ",45
"If, in this battle, the sons of Dhrtarastra, armed with weapons, kill me, who am non-resistant and unarmed, that will be more beneficial for me.","यदि मामप्रतीकारमशस्त्रं शस्त्रपाणयः।

धार्तराष्ट्रा रणे हन्युस्तन्मे क्षेमतरं भवेत्।।1.46।।
 ",46
"Sanjaya narrated: Having said so, Arjuna, with a mind afflicted by sorrow, sat down on the chariot in the midst of the battle, casting aside his bow along with the arrows.","सञ्जय उवाच

"O Partha, do not yield to unmanliness. This does not befit you. O scorcher of foes, arise, giving up the petty weakness of heart.","क्लैब्यं मा स्म गमः पार्थ नैतत्त्वय्युपपद्यते।

"Arjuna said, ""O Madhusudana, O destroyer of enemies, how can I fight with arrows in battle against Bhisma and Drona, who are worthy of adoration?""","अर्जुन उवाच

"Rather than killing the noble-minded elders, it is better in this world to live even on alms. But by killing them, we shall only be enjoying here the pleasures of wealth and desirable things drenched in blood.","गुरूनहत्वा हि महानुभावान्

"We do not know which is better for us, whether we shall win or they shall conquer us. Those very sons of Dhrtarastra, whom we do not wish to kill, stand in confrontation.","न चैतद्विद्मः कतरन्नो गरीयो

"With my nature overpowered by weak commiseration, my mind bewildered about duty, I supplicate You. Tell me for certain what is better; I am Your disciple, having taken refuge in You. Instruct me.","कार्पण्यदोषोपहतस्वभावः

"For I do not see anything that, even after acquiring on this earth a prosperous kingdom free from enemies and even sovereignty over the gods, can remove my sorrow that is blasting the senses.","न हि प्रपश्यामि ममापनुद्या

"As boyhood, youth, and decrepitude are to an embodied being in this present body, so is the acquisition of another body. Therefore, an intelligent person does not get deluded.","देहिनोऽस्मिन्यथा देहे कौमारं यौवनं जरा।

 ",60
"But the contacts of the organs with the objects are the producers of cold and heat, happiness, and sorrow. They have a beginning and an end and are transient. Bear them, O descendant of Bharata.","मात्रास्पर्शास्तु कौन्तेय शीतोष्णसुखदुःखदाः।

"He who thinks of this One as the killer, and he who thinks of this One as the one being killed, both of them do not know. This One neither kills nor is It killed.","य एनं वेत्ति हन्तारं यश्चैनं मन्यते हतम्।

"But, O Arjuna, Yoga is not for one who eats excessively, nor for one who does not eat at all; neither for one who habitually sleeps too long, nor for one who stays awake.","नात्यश्नतस्तु योगोऽस्ति न चैकान्तमनश्नतः।

न चातिस्वप्नशीलस्य जाग्रतो नैव चार्जुन।।6.16।।

A person who has become free from hankering for all desirable objects is said to be Self-absorbed when the controlled mind rests solely in the Self.,"यदा विनियतं चित्तमात्मन्येवावतिष्ठते।

निःस्पृहः सर्वकामेभ्यो युक्त इत्युच्यते तदा।।6.18।।

यत्र चैवात्मनाऽऽत्मानं पश्यन्नात्मनि तुष्यति।।6.20।।

"When one experiences that absolute Bliss, which can be intuited by the intellect and which is beyond the senses, and being thus established, this person surely does not swerve from Reality.","सुखमात्यन्तिकं यत्तद्बुद्धिग्राह्यमतीन्द्रियम्।

वेत्ति यत्र न चैवायं स्थितश्चलति तत्त्वतः।।6.21।।

"Obtaining which one does not consider any other acquisition to be superior, and being established in which one is not perturbed even by great sorrow;","यं लब्ध्वा चापरं लाभं मन्यते नाधिकं ततः।

यस्मिन्स्थितो न दुःखेन गुरुणापि विचाल्यते।।6.22।।
 ",255
One should know that severance of contact with sorrow to be what is called Yoga. That Yoga should be practiced with perseverance and with an undepressed heart.,"तं विद्याद् दुःखसंयोगवियोगं योगसंज्ञितम्।

"One who has their mind Self-absorbed through Yoga, and who has the vision of sameness everywhere, sees this Self existing in everything, and everything in their Self.","सर्वभूतस्थमात्मानं सर्वभूतानि चात्मनि।
